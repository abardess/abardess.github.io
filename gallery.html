<h3>Final Projects 2022</h3>
<p>The poster portion of our <a href="documents/waves_final.pdf">final project</a> from 2022, during my student teaching.
	Students researched and explained how a specific technology works and uses waves to function. They chose their own topics and did all the poster design.
	Lots of fantastic work here! I was overjoyed to recieve these!</p>
