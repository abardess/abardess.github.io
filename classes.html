		<h2>P Chemistry (SC350)</h2>
 
		<p>This class serves as an introduction to the physical sciences and the basics of chemisty.
		Broadly, the big ideas we cover as the conservation of energy and matter, the atomic structure of matter, the dynamics of chemical reactions, 
		and how these chemical and physical processes shape the dynamics of the Earth's various systems.</p>
		<p>In this class, I teach students how to plan and carry out experiments in our lab space, how to gather and interpret data, and how to be responisble and communicative scientists. We use
		these practices as we explore the big ideas of the class and learn about what the world around us is made of, and how its pieces behave.</p>

		<h2>AP Computer Science Principles (MA214)</h2>

		<p>Course Description: AP Computer Science Principles is a one-year, college level, non- calculus based introduction to the central ideas of Computer Science.
		The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology
		can impact the world. The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields
		and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.
		</p>
		<p>
		The curriculum for this class is taken primarily from <a href="https://studio.code.org/home">code.org</a>.

		<p>As I'm sure most are aware, teachers are always in need of more resources to support their teaching.
		I have made an amazon wishlist with items that will help me provide more for students, or which I want to help organize my classroom.
		Do not feel you have to buy directly from amazon; I will gladly accept direct donations of these items as well.
		You can <a href="mailto:integra_bardessono@nvusd.org">conatct me</a> or drop them off at the school's front office. </p>
		<p>My classroom wishlist can be found <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3ICMOT6Y1QN8C?ref_=wl_share"  target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15iWn86W5GRK3oeftDUSii6WWQdWC1xKwPFvTRKCect4/edit"  target="_blank">Maker Items</a></h2>
		<p>I am in the process of creating a small <a href="https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/">Makerspace</a> in my room.
	I already have a few activities planned to integrate into my teaching, and I would like to build up the resources to start expanding my curricula.
	I want to bring out the more creative, crafty impulses of my students, and Making activies interate perfectly into that philosophy.</p>

		<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15iWn86W5GRK3oeftDUSii6WWQdWC1xKwPFvTRKCect4/edit" target="_blank">Here</a> is a list of items you can donate.
		I will try to keep it updated as I fill up or run low on specific supplies.</p>
