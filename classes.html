		<h2>P Chemistry (SC350)</h2>
 
		<p>This class serves as an introduction to the physical sciences and the basics of chemisty.
		Broadly, the big ideas we cover as the conservation of energy and matter, the atomic structure of matter, the dynamics of chemical reactions, 
		and how these chemical and physical processes shape the dynamics of the Earth's various systems.</p>
		<p>In this class, I teach students how to plan and carry out experiments in our lab space, how to gather and interpret data, and how to be responisble and communicative scientists. We use
		these practices as we explore the big ideas of the class and learn about what the world around us is made of, and how its pieces behave.</p>

		<h2>AP Computer Science Principles (MA214)</h2>

		<p>Course Description: AP Computer Science Principles is a one-year, college level, non- calculus based introduction to the central ideas of Computer Science.
		The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology
		can impact the world. The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields
		and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.
		</p>
		<p>
		The curriculum for this class is taken primarily from <a href="https://studio.code.org/home">code.org</a>.
