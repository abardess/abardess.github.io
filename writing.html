<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>I read a fair number of books, and recently I have started a blog where I will be posting reviews/my
thoughts on the works that I have read. I have focused mainly on science-fiction thus far, but I will no doubt
expand the longer I keep it up. I might also start posting about movies/games/etc. the more I get into it.

<h2>Book</h2>

I have also writen a novel: <i>Thalci Varner and the Red Children of Paradise</i>. It is hard sci-fi, set in a future where
humanity has sent out a generation ship to colonize another planet. The ship, however, has taken so long to arrive on the
new planet that it's inhabitents have forgotten where they have come from. The story begins when they finally land on this
new planet, and our characters must struggle to overcome their personal and cultural crises as they reconcile their own beliefs
with the bizarre new world they discover around themselves.

I had done quite a bit of wiring on my own time before this (also in school, of course), but this was by far the largest project
I have ever completed. I finished the first draft in about six months, by the end of December 2017, and published it the following
Febuary. I am quite pleased with the result, and I have recieved good feedback from my family and friends who have read it.  If you are interested,
it is avalible through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thalci-Varner-Red-Children-Paradise-ebook/dp/B079RY1LFZ/"> Amazon</a>, in both 
print and Kindle formats, and also on <a href = "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/thalci-varner-and-the-red-children-of-paradise"> Kobo</a> in ebook format.
