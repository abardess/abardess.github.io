		<h2>Blog</h2>
		<p>I read a fair number of books, and have blogged on and off reviews/my thoughts on the works that I have read.
I focus mainly on science-fiction, but I will write about anything that interests me,
including video games or movies, and occasional travel blogging.
<a href="https://bloggishbabble.blogspot.com/"> Check it out if you are interested in what I think about things.</a>
</p>

		<h2>Book</h2>

		<p> I have also writen a novel: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thalci-Varner-Red-Children-Paradise-ebook/dp/B079RY1LFZ/"> <i>Thalci Varner and the Red Children of Paradise</i></a>.
It is hard sci-fi, set in a future where humanity has sent out a generation ship to colonize another planet. The ship, however, has taken so long to arrive on the
new planet that it's inhabitents have forgotten where they have come from. The story begins when they finally land on this
new planet, and our characters must struggle to overcome their personal and cultural crises as they reconcile their own beliefs
with the bizarre new world they discover around themselves.

I had done quite a bit of wiring on my own time before this (also in school, of course), but this was by far the largest project
I have ever completed. I finished the first draft in about six months, by the end of December 2017, and published it the following
Febuary. I am quite pleased with the result, and I have recieved good feedback from my family and friends who have read it.  If you are interested,
it is avalible through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thalci-Varner-Red-Children-Paradise-ebook/dp/B079RY1LFZ/"> Amazon</a>, in both 
print and Kindle formats. </p>

		<img class="cover" src="images/book_cover.png" alt="cover art of my book, 'Thalci Varner and the Red Children of Paradise'.
Cover consists of a black woman laying in a pool of water, blood dripping from her forehead. Red cloth floats in tatters at her waist.
Her body is obscured by the water and the title in the center of the image. A hand reaches down from the top of the frame, as if grasping at her mind.
The hand is white and shimmers with a rainbow of colors from the light reflecting off of the water."></a>
