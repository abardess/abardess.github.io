<p> I am a recent graduate of California Polytechnic State University, where I recieved 
a bachelors in physics and a minor in mathematics. I have over two years experience
coding in Python, as well as experience using LaTeX, Mathematica, and MatLab. I have
worked on several mathematical modeling projects during my time at Cal Poly and
have experience with a variety of labratory instrumentation. I am currently working
as a tutor in my hometown and am looking for more permenant work in California.
I am also in the midst of writing a science fiction novel, which I plan
to finish by the end of the year.


<h4>Academic Projects and Papers</h4>

<ul>
<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/sp.pdf" target = "_blank">Black Holes Modeled as Fluid Droplets on Membranes</a> (Author, Programmer)</li>
<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/polymer.pdf" target = "_blank">Analysis of Polymer Solar Cells</a> (Author)</li>
<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/mcm2016.pdf" target = "_blank">MCM 2016 - Distribution of Grant Money</a> (Co-Author)</li>
<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/mcm2015.pdf" target = "_blank">MCM 2015 - Ebola Outbreak</a> (Co-Author, Programmer)</li>
</ul>

<p>All four papers were written using LaTeX. The first link is my senior project thesis. The second is an anlysis of solar cell 
performance, written as the final report of an upper-division lab I took at Cal Poly.
The latter two were submitted as entries for the international
<a href = "https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/" target = "_blank">
Mathematical Modeling Competition</a>. My team recived an Honorable Mention (top 40%) for
our 2015 entry and a Meritorious (top 8%) for our 2016 entry. I did all of the coding needed
in <i>i</i> and <i>iv</i>, and also produced all the graphics therein (unless otherwise sourced).</p>
