		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p> My name is Anthony Bardessono. I am a graduate of both <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">California Polytechnic State University</a> and Sonoma State University.	At Cal Poly I received 
a bachelors in physics and a minor in mathematics, and at SSU I recieved a credential for teaching Secondary Science in Physics and Chemistry. Before achieving my credential, I
had worked in educational settings with children for over five years. I also  have experience usign coding languages such as LaTeX, Mathematica, MatLab, and the Godot Engine. I
worked on several mathematical modeling <a href="papers.html">projects</a> during my time at Cal Poly and
have experience with a variety of laboratory instrumentation. I am also a self-published author.</p>

		<p>I have tutored mathematics and physics on and off since 2012, teaching middle-, high-school, and freshman college students in one-on-one sessions. I tutored independantly,
		as well as through SurferMath and <a href="https://locations.sylvanlearning.com/us/napa-valley-ca/">Sylvan Tutoring</a>.</p>

		<p> After my undergraduate studies, I worked as an instructor at <a href ="http://www.astrocampva.com/"> AstroCamp, VA</a>, where I helped teach students about a variety of science topics.
		In addition to managing small classess, I helped develop many programs for the burgeoning camp and created a variety of documentation including instruction manuals, learning aids, and lesson plans.
I also gained experince in building and maintaining a variety of circuitry, including a set of ANET A8 3D printers.</p>

		</p>Currently I am looking to apply my teaching credential and looking for work in California, ideally near the Bay Area.</p>

		<p>I also do a lot of reading and writing. I have published a science fiction <a href="writing.html">novel</a> through Amazon (sequel in the works).
And I have a <a href="https://bloggishbabble.blogspot.com/">blog</a> where I post my thoughts and recommendations about the books I read; though I have not had time to update the blog as of late.</p>
