<h1> Welcome!</h1>

<p> My name is Anthony Bardessono.</p>

<p>I am a graduate of <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">California Polytechnic State University</a>, where I received 
a bachelors in physics and a minor in mathematics. I have over three years experience
coding in Python, as well as experience using LaTeX, Mathematica, and MatLab. I have
worked on several mathematical modeling <a href="papers.html">projects</a> during my time at Cal Poly and
have experience with a variety of laboratory instrumentation.</p>

<p>Most recently I worked as an instructor at <a href ="http://www.astrocampva.com/">
AstroCamp, VA</a>, where I helped teach students about a variety of science topics. In addition to managing students, I
helped develop many programs for the burgeoning camp and created a variety of documentation including instruction manuals, learning aids, and lesson plans.
I also gained experince in building and maintaining a variety of circuitry, including a set of ANET A8 3D printers.
Currently I am working toward a teaching credential while looking for work in California, ideally near the Bay Area.
</p>

<p>I also do a lot of reading and writing. I have published a science fiction <a href="writing.html">novel</a> through Amazon (sequel in the works).
And I have a <a href="https://bloggishbabble.blogspot.com/">blog</a> where I post my thoughts and 
recommendations about the books I read.</p>
