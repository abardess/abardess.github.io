			<h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
			<p> I am Teacher Bardessono, and here you will find information about myself, my <a href="classes.html">classes</a>, and some of the teaching <a href="resources.html">resources</a>
				I have gathered through my time as an educator. Each topic has its own page, and if you are a student in one of my classes I will have specific resources posted on each classroom page.
				I maintain this webpage myself, so it's a constant work in progess. That said, if you notice any critical errors feel free to reach out!
				</p>
				
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Integra Bardessono. I am a native resident of Napa and am excited by the prospect of giving back to my community as a teacher,
				as well as continuing to provide opportunities for students to learn and practice science in a safe and caring environment.In my free time I enjoy swimming, video games, 
				and a lot of reading and writing. I have self-published a science fiction <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thalci-Varner-Red-Children-Paradise-ebook/dp/1973585316/">novel</a> online, and occasionally write 
				<a href="https://bloggishbabble.blogspot.com/">reviews</a> of the books I read, and sometimes other media.
			</p>

			<h2>Philosophy</h2>
			<p>I believe that education should be an empowering and that learning should be gratifying. I want all my students to be able to explore 
				science in meaningful and relevant ways, and approach the problems they face in and out of the classroom with curiosity and confidence. 
				To this end, I understand that the science classroom is much more than the theories discussed within, it is driven by the relationships 
				between students and teacher. I want my classrooms to feel like a home space, where students are able to express themselves genuinely and 
				can trust me and each other to listen to what they have to say. When students and teachers trust each other, the exploration of the natural 
				world and deep science concepts becomes enlightening, not mystifying, and students learn to approach difficult problems with confidence.
			</p>
			<p>I regard the practice of pedagogy in the same manner I regard the practice of science; in that it is an active process and never a finished product.
				I am always keeping my students in mind as I adapt lessons to the specific tone of each class I teach. I am constantly working to understand and redress
				the barriers that keep students from succeeding, whether that be at home, in school, or in my classroom. To that end, I am constantly working to make the
				classrooms I occupy accepting and validating so that students may grow as burgeoning adults and lifelong learners.

			<h2>Experience</h2>
				
			<!-- <a href = "" target = "_blank"><h3>Teaching Credential (Sonoma State)</h3></a> -->
				
			<p>I have over five years working with and helping to educate students at the high school and middle school levels; I have worked on and off as a math tutor since 
				I graduated from <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">California Polytechnic State University</a>  in 2016, and I worked for three years as a camp instructor at a 
				<a href ="http://www.astrocampva.com/"> AstroCamp, VA</a>, where I had the opportunity to provide for campers with a wide range of interests and needs. I have a great 
				deal of experience developing curriculum for and presenting science concepts to a large range of learners, from 4th grade up through high school. After my experience 
				working there, I decided to become a teacher, and in 2022 I graduated from Sonoma State University with credentials in physics and chemistry.
			</p>
				
			<p>During my time in the program working as a student teacher, I had the chance to work and teach in both physics and chemistry classes, as well as participate occasionally
				in a smattering of other subjects such as biology, mathematics, and computer science. Throughout all my experiences, I have found myself to be patient and curious in my
				teachingâ€”watching students find insight and moments of revelation as they grapple with science concepts has been a repeated joy throughout my career, and I am always
				looking for new ways to help students make those connections as they engage with science and the natural world.

			<h3>Academic Projects and Papers (Cal Poly, SLO)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/sp.pdf" target = "_blank">Black Holes Modeled as Fluid Droplets on Membranes</a> (Author, Programmer)</li>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/polymer.pdf" target = "_blank">Analysis of Polymer Solar Cells</a> (Author)</li>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/mcm2016.pdf" target = "_blank">MCM 2016 - Distribution of Grant Money</a> (Co-Author)</li>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/mcm2015.pdf" target = "_blank">MCM 2015 - Ebola Outbreak</a> (Co-Author, Programmer)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>All four papers were written using LaTeX. The first link is my senior project thesis. The second is an anlysis of solar cell 
				performance, written as the final report of an upper-division lab I took at Cal Poly. The latter two were submitted as entries for the international
				<a href = "https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/" target = "_blank"> Mathematical Modeling Competition</a>. My team recived an Honorable Mention (top 40%) for
				our 2015 entry and a Meritorious (top 8%) for our 2016 entry. I did all of the coding needed in the first and fourth paper, and also produced all the graphics therein (unless otherwise sourced).</p>
