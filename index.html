			<h2 >Hello and Welcome!</h2>
			<p> I am Integra Bardessono (my students call me Teacher, or Teacher B) and here you will find information about myself, my pedagogy, and some of the teaching <a href="resources.html">resources</a>
				I have gathered through my time as an educator. My hope is that, long term, other educators and students may take value from these resources as I compile them.
				I maintain this webpage myself, and generally update it only once or twice a year, so it's a constant work in progress, and it is currently thin on content.
				That said, if you notice any critical errors feel free to reach out!
				</p>
				
			<h2>A Brief History</h2>
			<p>I am a lifelong resident of Napa and started my teaching Career in 2022. I am happy to be giving back to my community as a teacher, and I strive to provide opportunities for students to learn and
			practice science in a safe and caring environment. In my free time I enjoy yoga, swimming, video games, coding, and a lot of reading and writing. I have self-published a science
			fiction <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGDVSGSX">novel</a> online, and occasionally write <a href="https://bloggishbabble.blogspot.com/">reviews</a> of the media (mostly books) I have enjoyed (or despise).
			However, cuurently it has been some time since I have had the time to sit down and compose a thoughtful critique. I am a mostly self-taught computer programmer, and have so far completed two <a href ="https://metalgearsamus.itch.io/">micro-games</a> as part of a yearly 48hr gamejam.
			I one day hope to publish a full-length video game.
			</p>

			<h2>Philosophy</h2>
			<p>I believe that education should be empowering and that learning should be gratifying. I want all my students to be able to explore 
				science in meaningful and relevant ways, and approach the problems they face in and out of the classroom with curiosity and confidence. 
				To this end, I understand that the science classroom is much more than the theories discussed within, it is driven by the relationships 
				between students and teacher. I want my classrooms to feel like a home space, where students are able to express themselves genuinely and 
				can trust me and each other to listen to what they have to say. When students and teachers trust each other, the exploration of the natural 
				world and deep science concepts becomes enlightening, not mystifying, and students learn to approach difficult problems with confidence.
			</p>
			<p>I regard the practice of pedagogy in the same manner I regard the practice of science; in that it is an iterative process and never a finished product.
				I am always keeping my students in mind as I adapt lessons to the specific tone of each class I teach. I am constantly working to understand and redress
				the barriers that keep students from succeeding, whether that be at home, in school, or in my classroom. To that end, I work to creatve inquiry-driven activities and
				center my students' voices so that they may burgeon into confident adults and lifelong learners.
			</p>
			<p>Information on the specific subjects I am teaching (or have taught) can be found <a href="classes.html">here.</a></p>

			<h2>Experience</h2>
				
			<!-- <a href = "" target = "_blank"><h3>Teaching Credential (Sonoma State)</h3></a> -->
				
			<p> Before I became a teacher, I spent over five years working with and helping to educate students at the high school and middle school levels; I worked on and off as a math tutor after
				I graduated from <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/">California Polytechnic State University</a> in 2016, and I worked for three years as a camp instructor at a 
				<a href ="http://www.astrocampva.com/"> AstroCamp, VA</a>, where I had the opportunity to provide for campers with a wide range of interests and needs. As a consequence, I gained a great deal
				of experience developing curricula and presenting science concepts to a large range of learners, from 4th grade up through high school.After my time at AstroCamp, I decided to
				become a teacher, and in 2022 I graduated from Sonoma State University with credentials in physics and chemistry.
			</p>
				
			<p>During my time working as a student teacher, I had the chance to work and teach in both physics and chemistry classes, as well as participate occasionally
				in a smattering of other subjects such as biology, mathematics, and computer science. Throughout all my experiences, I have found myself to be patient and curious in my
				teaching. Watching students find insight and moments of revelation as they grapple with science concepts has been a repeated joy in my career, and I am always
				looking for new ways to help students make those connections as they engage with the natural world.

			<h3>Academic Projects and Papers (Cal Poly, SLO)</h3>

			<ul>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/sp.pdf" target = "_blank">Black Holes Modeled as Fluid Droplets on Membranes</a> (Author, Programmer)</li>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/polymer.pdf" target = "_blank">Analysis of Polymer Solar Cells</a> (Author)</li>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/mcm2016.pdf" target = "_blank">MCM 2016 - Distribution of Grant Money</a> (Co-Author)</li>
				<li class="roman"><a href = "documents/mcm2015.pdf" target = "_blank">MCM 2015 - Ebola Outbreak</a> (Co-Author, Programmer)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Above are some of my college projects. All four papers were written using LaTeX. The first link is my senior project thesis. The second is an anlysis of solar cell 
				performance, written as the final report of an upper-division lab I took at Cal Poly. The latter two were submitted as entries for the international
				<a href = "https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/" target = "_blank"> Mathematical Modeling Competition</a>. My team recived an Honorable Mention (top 40%) for
				our 2015 entry and a Meritorious (top 8%) for our 2016 entry. I did all of the coding needed in the first and fourth paper, and also produced all the graphics therein (unless otherwise sourced).</p>
				<p>Note: The papers above were composed before I made my transition. I am still very pround of my work, but as such I have redacted my old name.<p>
