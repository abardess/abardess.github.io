<h1> Welcome!</h1>

<p> My name is Anthony Bardessono. I am a graduate of California Polytechnic State University, where I received 
a bachelors in physics and a minor in mathematics. I have over three years experience
coding in Python, as well as experience using LaTeX, Mathematica, and MatLab. I have
worked on several mathematical modeling <a href="papers.html">projects</a> during my time at Cal Poly and
have experience with a variety of laboratory instrumentation. I am currently working
as an instructor at <a href="http://www.astrocampva.com/">AstroCamp Virginia</a>, helping teaching science to visiting students
and enriching their education.</p>

<p>I also do a lot of reading and writing. I have published a science fiction <a href="writing.html">novel</a> through Amazon,
and I have recently started a <a href="https://bloggishbabble.blogspot.com/">blog</a> where I post my thoughts and 
recommendations about the books I read.</p>

I can be reached via <a href="mailto:AntBardessono@Gmail.com">Email</a>, or through any social media you find me on.
